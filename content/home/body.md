>Hi there, Brian here. I had a lot of fun playing [You Are Jeff Bezos](https://direkris.itch.io/you-are-jeff-bezos) by Kris Ligman so I decided to make my own Choose Your Own Adventure game. I'm not done writing the story yet, so stay tuned. In the meantime, you can ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brianrose). Cheers!
